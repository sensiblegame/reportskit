1. Add ReportsKit

Gemfile

source 'https://my-api-key@gems.reportskit.co' do
  gem 'reportskit'
end


2. Configure Models

Configure the filters and dimensions that can be used in your reports:

app/models/task.rb

class Task < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :assignee
  belongs_to :project

  reportskit do
    filter :assignee
    filter :project
    filter :completed_at
    filter :is_completed, :boolean, conditions: -> { where.not(completed_at: nil) }

    dimension :assignee
    dimension :project
    dimension :completed_at
  end
end


3. Configure Reports

config/reportskit/reports/completed_tasks.yml

name: Completed tasks
measures:
- tasks
dimensions:
- completed_at
display_format: area


4. Add Report to a View

app/views/reports/my_view.html.haml

= render_report 'completed_tasks'


5. Add Routes:

config/routes.rb

mount ReportsKit::Engine, at: '/reports'

That's it! You can now visit the view in step 4. to see the report that you've configured.
